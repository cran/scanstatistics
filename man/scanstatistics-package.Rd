\title{scanstatistics: Space-time anomaly detection using scan statistics.}
\description{
The scanstatistics package provides two categories of important functions:
data preparation functions, and the scan statistics themselves.
}
\section{Data preparation functions}{

These functions prepare your data for use. In particular, it helps you 
define the \emph{zones} which will be considered by the scan statistics.
}

\section{Scan statistics}{

These are the functions used for space-time anomaly detection. Scan statistic
functions for univariate space-time data have a name that begins with 
\code{scan_} and functions for multivariate space-time data have a name that
begins with \code{mscan_}.
