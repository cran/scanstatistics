\title{Get the top (non-overlappig) clusters.}
\usage{
top_clusters(
  x,
  zones,
  k = 5,
  overlapping = FALSE,
  gumbel = FALSE,
  alpha = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class scanstatistics.}

\item{zones}{A list of integer vectors.}

\item{k}{An integer, the number of clusters to return.}

\item{overlapping}{Logical; should the top clusters be allowed to overlap in
the spatial dimension? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{gumbel}{Logical; should a Gumbel P-value be calculated? The default is 
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{alpha}{A significance level, which if not \code{NULL} will be used to
calculate a critical value for the statistics in the table.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{\link[stats]{quantile}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with at most \eqn{k} rows, with columns 
   \code{zone, duration, score} and possibly \code{MC_pvalue, Gumbel_pvalue}
   and \code{critical_value}.
}
\description{
Get the top \eqn{k} space-time clusters according to the statistic calculated
for each cluster (the maximum being the scan statistic). The default is to 
return the spatially non-overlapping clusters, i.e. those that do not have 
any locations in common.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
counts <- matrix(rpois(15, 3), 3, 5)
zones <- list(1:2, 1:3, 2:5, c(1, 3), 4:5, c(1, 5))
scanres <- scan_permutation(counts, zones, n_mcsim = 5)
top_clusters(scanres, zones, k = 4, overlapping = FALSE)
